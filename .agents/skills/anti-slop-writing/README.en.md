# anti-slop-writing

**v3.0** — July 6, 2026

[Bahasa Indonesia](README.md) | English

A universal skill that makes AI output read more human, specific, and less stiff.

Works with **Claude.ai, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf**, and any tool that supports system prompts.

Based on Wikipedia ["Signs of AI Writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) + AI text detection research. Inspired by [@mkbijaksana](https://x.com/mkbijaksana/status/2027714311330627877).

## What's New in v3.0

- **2026 Shift:** cadence uniformity as #1 tell, 30-second tests, prompt keyword repetition
- **Model Fingerprints:** GPT-5.x Motivator dialect, Claude Philosopher dialect (Opus 4.5 corpus data)
- **New rules:** Break the Four-Part Sentence DNA, bimodal burstiness trap, paragraph over-fragmentation
- **Two-way passive correction:** newer models use *less* passive than humans
- **Colon/semicolon density rules**
- **New 2026 vocabulary bans:** ensuring, plays-a-role-in-shaping, intensifiers
- **12 new checklist items** (36 total for EN, 48 for ID)
- **New ID-specific rules:** BI-11 (symmetric hook), BI-12 (prompt repetition), anti-translationese

## Before vs After

**Without this skill:**
> The festival serves as a vibrant testament to the region's rich cultural heritage, showcasing the intricate tapestry of traditions that have endured through the ages, contributing to the broader social fabric of the community.

**With this skill:**
> The festival has run every April since 1987. Locals build their own stalls. The goat cheese and handmade pottery sell out by noon.

## Quick Start

### Claude.ai (Web) — Easiest

1. Download `anti-slop-writing-en.skill` (English) or `anti-slop-writing-id.skill` (Indonesian) from the [latest release](https://github.com/adenaufal/anti-slop-writing/releases/latest)
2. In Claude.ai: `Settings → Skills → Install from file`
3. Select the downloaded file
4. Start a new chat and go

### Claude Code

```bash
# Global
git clone https://github.com/adenaufal/anti-slop-writing ~/.claude/skills/anti-slop-writing

# Or per-project
git clone https://github.com/adenaufal/anti-slop-writing .claude/skills/anti-slop-writing
```

Skill file: `english/SKILL.md` (English) or `indonesian/SKILL.md` (Bahasa Indonesia).

### Other Tools (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, ChatGPT)

See [Full Installation](#full-installation) below.

## How to Use

Use natural prompts:
- "Rewrite this so it sounds more human."
- "Make this not read like AI."
- "No slop. Keep it direct."

In Claude Code you can also use `/anti-slop-writing`.

### Quick Check

Send this test prompt:

```text
Rewrite this paragraph into 2 versions:
1) short formal version
2) casual version
Both must stay natural and avoid AI template phrasing.
```

If output is more concrete and sentence rhythm varies, the rules are active.
